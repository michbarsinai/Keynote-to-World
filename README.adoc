= Keynote-to-World

A small AppleScript utility that translate a Keynote presentation into a PowerPoint and a PDF. The generated PDF maintains all transitions. The PowerPoint one maintains compatibility based on Keynote's export (so, most of the stuff works).

To use: save as an application and drop the Keynote files on the application icon. Supports multiple files.
